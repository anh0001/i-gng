# Growing Neural Gas (Python)

This repository contains a high-performance C++ implementation of the online Growing Neural Gas (GNG) clustering algorithm together with brand-new Python bindings powered by [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/). The legacy R wrapper has been removed – everything you need now ships as a standard Python package.

The goals of the project remain the same:

- **Fast online clustering** that can adapt to non-stationary streams.
- **Compact graph output** describing cluster topology.
- **Scalability** thanks to a memory-efficient core and optional optimisations.

## Installation

The project uses a PEP 517 build powered by `setuptools` and `pybind11`. Build and install it in editable mode while developing:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
pip install -e .
```

This compiles the extension against your system toolchain (a C++17-capable compiler is required).

## Quick start

```python
import numpy as np
from gng import GNGConfiguration, GrowingNeuralGas

# Configure the dimensionality of your data
config = GNGConfiguration()
config.dim = 2
config.max_nodes = 50
config.uniformgrid_optimization = True
config.set_bounding_box(0.0, 1.0)
config.check()  # optional validation

gng = GrowingNeuralGas(config)

# Provide training samples
points = np.random.rand(10_000, config.dim)
gng.insert(points, run_after=True)

# Let the background thread adapt for a while then pause
gng.pause()

print("Mean error:", gng.mean_error())
print("Nodes:", len(gng.nodes()))
closest = gng.predict([0.5, 0.5])
print("Closest node index:", closest)

gng.terminate()
```

Under the hood `GrowingNeuralGas` is just a convenience layer on top of the exposed `GNGServer` and `GNGConfiguration` classes, so you can drop down to the lower-level API whenever you need finer control.

## Project layout

```
inst/include/    # C++ headers for the GNG core
src/             # Core implementation + Python binding module
python/gng/      # High-level Python helpers
tests/cpp/       # Legacy C++ test scaffolding
tests/python/    # Pytest-based smoke tests
```

The `setup.py` entry points compile all C++ sources into a single extension called `gng._core`. This keeps imports fast and makes deployment easy.

## Testing

Python tests live under `tests/python`. After installing the package in editable mode run:

```bash
pytest
```

The suite currently focuses on ensuring that the bindings load correctly, can ingest data, and expose the expected high-level helpers. Feel free to expand it with more rigorous checks.
